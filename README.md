# Simple Quiz

This game template was used to celebrate the one-off episode of the Emberseed
podcast my friend and I recorded, with some transatlantic guests, focusing on
the 2014 HBO hit series _True Detective_.

It's a multiple-choice quiz, where the correct answer is rewarded with a "bing"
and the wrong with a "boop" (or equivalent noises). The points are tallied up
at the end and there are different congratulatory, or admonishing phrases
depending on how well you did, which you can share with your friends.

You can swap out the `lib/js/data.js` file and the `assets` directory to make
this quiz your own.
